aiozipkin's documentation!
===========================

**aiozipkin** is Python 3.5+ module that adds distributed tracing capabilities
from asyncio applications with Zipkin (http://zipkin.io) server instrumentation.

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed
to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages
both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on
the Google Dapper paper.
